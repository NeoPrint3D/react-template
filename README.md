# NeoPrint3D`s React Template
## Introduction:
I made this template to reduce the time to get started with a new project. I chose Next.js as the framework because it is a simple and easy to use with features like static site generation and server side generation. I also chose React because it is a popular framework.
## Features:
- Server/Static Site Generation
- Firebase Support out of the box
- SEO friendly
- Icons pre-installed
- React-Use for useful hooks
- Framer-Motion for animations
- TailwindCSS for styling
- DaisyUI for premade UI components
- CryptoJS for encryption
- Image compression for Static Site Generation
